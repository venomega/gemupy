##### TODO:
 - docs
 - graphical interface?
 - 4bits length joystick support


There are situations where a software doesn`t read propertly a joystick or a joystick that could be readed by the kernel, but not very well by other programs.

This program is intended to capture a joystick input and put on applications a keyboard key of your choise, or convert a joystick input to a keyboard output that works on any program.


##### Support
 - key up & down
 - digital keys & analog keys
 - it can`t differentiate between various analog inputs on same xis
 - custom map keys

The only thing needed is a ```/dev/input/js*``` file and ```xdotool``` program
